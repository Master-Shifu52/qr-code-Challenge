# Frontend Mentor - QR Code Component Solution

This is my solution to the [QR Code Component Challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). It's a beginner-friendly project that allowed me to sharpen my HTML and CSS layout skills, with a focus on responsiveness and design accuracy.

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic **HTML5**
- **CSS Flexbox** for layout
- **Google Fonts (Outfit)** for typography
- **Mobile-first** workflow
- Vanilla CSS (no frameworks)

### What I Learned

This project helped me understand how to:

- Use Flexbox to center items vertically and horizontally.
- Apply clean and modern design techniques (rounded corners, shadows, font styling).
- Build mobile-first, responsive components with scalable design.

#### Sample Code Snippet

\`\`\`css
.container {
  width: 320px;
  height: 499px;
  background-color: #FFFFFF;
  border-radius: 20px;
  margin: 100px auto;
}
\`\`\`

### Continued Development

In future projects, I want to:

- Focus more on accessibility (ARIA attributes, alt text improvement).
- Explore utility-first frameworks like Tailwind CSS for component structuring.
- Add light/dark mode toggles to enhance user experience.

### Useful Resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) – A go-to resource for understanding Flexbox.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) – For choosing modern, web-safe fonts like **Outfit**.
- [Frontend Mentor Community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/community) – For inspiration and feedback.
